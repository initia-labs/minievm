# ETH JSON-RPC

The ETH JSON-RPC (Remote Procedure Call) is a protocol that allows clients to interact with Ethereum nodes using JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) messages over HTTP or IPC (Inter-Process Communication). It provides a standardized way to communicate with the Ethereum network and perform various operations such as querying blockchain data, executing smart contracts, and managing accounts.
